            <p><b>OD</b><br>
                 My Queen! what dost thou? Never call him forth.</p>
                 <p><b>ATH</b><br>
ATH. Hush, hush! Be not so timorous, but endure.</p>
<p><b>OD</b><br>
 Nay, nay! Enough. He is there, and let him bide.</p>
 <p><b>ATH</b><br>
What fear you? Dates his valour from to day?</p>
<p><b>OD</b><br>
He was and is my valiant enemy.</p>
<p><b>ATH</b><br>
 Then is not laughter sweetest o’er a foe?</p>
 <p><b>OD</b><br>
 No more! I care not he should pass abroad.</p>
 <p><b>ATh</b><br>
 You flinch from seeing the madman in full view.</p>
 <p><b>OD</b><br>
     When sane, I ne’er had flinched before his face.</p>
     <p><b>ATH</b><br>
 Well, but even now he shall not know thee near.</p>
 <p><b>OD</b><br>
 How, if his eyes be not transformed or lost?</p>
 <p><b>ATH</b><br>
 I will confound his sense although he see.</p>
 <p><b>OD</b><br>
     Well, nothing is too hard for Deity.</p>
     <p><b>ATH</b><br>
 Stand still and keep thy place without a word.</p>
 <p><b>OD</b><br>
 I must. Would I were far away from here!</p>
