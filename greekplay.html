            <h1>Mahendra kumar presents a Greek play by Sophocles</h1>
            <h6>ELECTRA and the Author Sophocles</h6>
            <p>Woe for my hapless lot!

                OLD M. Hark! from the doors, my son, methought there came
                A moaning cry, as of some maid within.
                
                OR. Can it be poor Electra? Shall we stay,
                And list again the lamentable sound?
                
                OLD M. Not so. Before all else begin the attempt
                To execute Apollo’s sovereign will,
                Pouring libation to thy sire: this makes
                Victory ours, and our success assured.
                OLD MAN. Son of the king who led the Achaean host
                Erewhile beleaguering Troy, ’tis thine to day
                To see around thee what through many a year
                Thy forward spirit hath sighed for. Argolis
                Lies here before us, hallowed as the scene
                Of Io’s wildering pain: yonder, the mart
                Named from the wolf slaying God, and there, to our left,
                Hera’s famed temple. For we reach the bourn
                Of far renowned Mycenae, rich in gold
                And Pelops’ fatal roofs before us rise,
                Haunted with many horrors, whence my hand,
                Thy murdered sire then lying in his gore,
                Received thee from thy sister, and removed
                Where I have kept thee safe and nourished thee
                To this bright manhood thou dost bear, to be
                The avenger of thy father’s bloody death.
                Wherefore, Orestes, and thou, Pylades,
                Dearest of friends, though from a foreign soil,
                Prepare your enterprise with speed. Dark night
                Is vanished with her stars, and day’s bright orb
                Hath waked the birds of morn into full song.
                Now, then, ere foot of man go forth, ye two
                Knit counsels. ’Tis no time for shy delay:
                The very moment for your act is come.
                
                OR. Kind faithful friend, how well thou mak’st appear
                Thy constancy in service to our house!
                As some good steed, aged, but nobly bred,
                Slacks not his spirit in the day of war,
                But points his ears to the fray, even so dost thou
                Press on and urge thy master in the van.</p>
